# Degrees-Of-Seperation

•	Designed a system to compute the "degrees of separation" between individuals within a network using shortest path algorithms.
•	Leveraged the IMDb dataset to analyze connections between actors, enabling insights into professional relationships and shared collaborations.
•	Simulated a LinkedIn-style connection mapping, identifying if a user is a 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 3rd+ degree connection.
•	Enhanced real-world applicability with BFS (Breadth-First Search) to efficiently find intermediaries between people.
